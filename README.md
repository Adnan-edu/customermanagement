# A sample readme for the Django project - Customer Order Management

The application I have developed is the customer management platform.
Admin can create customer and customer order, along with viewing the customer and updating customer information. It also has the ability to search customer information using a multiparameter search form(django-filter). Moreover, I have also added login authentication, password resetting by sending email, signals and many more.
Each order has three stages of status such as pending, out for delivery, delivered.
